## Privacy Features

**GDPR-Compliant Consent System:**

Users control their data through slash commands:
- **/wompbot_consent**: Give consent for data processing (required for most features)
- **/wompbot_noconsent**: Withdraw consent and opt out of data collection
- **/download_my_data**: Export all your data in JSON format (GDPR Art. 15)

- Message content and usernames are redacted before storage (only metadata retained)
- Messages are flagged as opted-out
- Excluded from behavior analysis
- Not included in conversation context or LLM prompts
- Most bot features unavailable

**Background jobs respect consent & rate limits:**
- Scheduled tasks persist their last successful run in `job_last_run`
- On startup each loop checks the stored timestamp and skips work until the interval (hourly/daily/weekly) elapses
- Prevents duplicate GDPR cleanup or iRacing snapshots after restarts while keeping cron cadence predictable
- New members automatically receive a welcome DM outlining consent choices and privacy commands (set `PRIVACY_DM_NEW_MEMBERS=0` to disable)

## Behavior Analysis

Weekly or on-demand analysis tracks:
- Profanity frequency (0-10 scale)
- Conversational tone
- Honesty patterns (fact-based vs exaggeration)

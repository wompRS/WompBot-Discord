## Team Management System

### New Database Tables (5 tables)

- `iracing_team_events`: Scheduled events (practice, qualifying, race, endurance)
- `iracing_driver_availability`: Driver availability tracking per event
- `iracing_stint_schedule`: Stint rotation for endurance races

### New Team Commands (6 commands)
- `/iracing_team_create` - Create a new team with name and tag
- `/iracing_team_invite` - Invite members with roles
- `/iracing_team_leave` - Leave a team
- `/iracing_team_info` - View team details and roster

- `/iracing_my_teams` - View your teams

### New Event Commands (5 commands)
- `/iracing_event_create` - Schedule team events with natural language time parsing
- `/iracing_team_events` - View upcoming team events
- `/iracing_event_availability` - Mark availability (available/unavailable/maybe/confirmed)
- `/iracing_event_roster` - View driver availability for an event
- `/iracing_upcoming_races` - Browse official iRacing race schedule

### New Special Events (2 commands planned)
- Special events browser for endurance races (Daytona 24, Le Mans, etc.)
- Stint rotation calculator for endurance events

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created (5 new files)
1. `sql/iracing_teams_migration.sql` - Database schema (5 tables, 9 indexes)
2. `bot/features/iracing_teams.py` - Team manager class (500+ lines)
3. `bot/iracing_team_commands.py` - Team management commands (300+ lines)
4. `bot/iracing_event_commands.py` - Event scheduling commands (400+ lines)

### Files Modified (5 files)
1. `bot/main.py`:
   - Added iRacingTeamManager initialization
   - Integrated team and event command setup
2. `bot/llm.py`:
   - Updated system prompt to professional tone
3. `README.md`:
   - Removed Feyd-Rautha persona references
4. `docker-compose.yml`:
   - Added team migration to initialization scripts
5. `bot/requirements.txt`:
   - Added python-dateutil==2.9.0 for natural language date parsing

## Features

### Team Management
- Multi-guild support (teams are server-specific)
- Role-based permissions (manager, driver, crew_chief, spotter)
- Team tags/abbreviations for easy identification
- Integration with existing iRacing account links

### Event Scheduling
- Natural language time parsing ("tomorrow 8pm", "Jan 15 7:00pm")
- Discord timestamp integration (shows in user's local timezone)
- Event types: practice, qualifying, race, endurance
- Optional series and track information
- Duration tracking for endurance races

### Driver Availability
- Four status levels: available, unavailable, maybe, confirmed
- Optional notes for partial availability
- Roster view showing all driver statuses
- Ready count for quick availability overview

### Integration
- Works with existing `/iracing_link` command
- Displays iRacing names when available
- Falls back to Discord mentions
- Compatible with iRacing API features

## Deployment Notes

**Database Migration**: New tables will be created automatically on next restart
**Backwards Compatible**: Existing features unaffected
**No Breaking Changes**: All new commands, no modifications to existing commands

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Teams can be created and members added
- [ ] Events can be scheduled with natural language times
- [ ] Availability can be set and viewed
- [ ] Team roster displays correctly
- [ ] Commands work without iRacing API (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Upcoming races command works with iRacing API

## Future Enhancements
- Stint rotation calculator for endurance events
- Special events browser (24h races, etc.)
- Automated reminders for scheduled events
- Practice session attendance tracking
- Team statistics and leaderboards

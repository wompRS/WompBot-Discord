feat(privacy): rename consent commands and remove role-based opt-out

BREAKING CHANGE: Privacy consent commands renamed and opt-out system changed

## Command Changes
- `/give_consent` â†’ `/wompbot_consent`
- `/withdraw_consent` â†’ `/wompbot_noconsent`

## System Changes
- Removed role-based opt-out system (NoDataCollection role)
- All opt-out checks now use GDPR consent database
- Message handler uses privacy_manager.get_consent_status() instead of role checks

## Files Modified
- bot/main.py: Removed OPT_OUT_ROLE constant and user_has_opted_out() function
- bot/privacy_commands.py: Renamed both consent commands
- GDPR_COMPLIANCE.md: Updated 6 command references
- GDPR_SELF_ATTESTATION.md: Updated 9 command references
- SECURITY_AND_GDPR_UPDATE.md: Updated 5 command references
- CHANGELOG.md: Added breaking change entries

## Migration Notes
- **Users**: Must use new command names (`/wompbot_consent`, `/wompbot_noconsent`)
- **No data migration needed**: Existing consent records remain valid
- **Role system deprecated**: NoDataCollection role no longer has any effect

## Why This Change?
- Better command naming consistency (all WompBot commands use wompbot_ prefix)
- Cleaner architecture (single source of truth for consent via database)
- Improved GDPR compliance (explicit consent tracking, not role-based)

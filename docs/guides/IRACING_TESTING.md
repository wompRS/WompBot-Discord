#### 8. Error Handling Tests
- [ ] **Test invalid driver name**
  - Error message clear and helpful
  - Suggests checking spelling
  - Doesn't crash bot

- [ ] **Test invalid category**
  - Shouldn't happen with autocomplete
  - But handle gracefully if it does

### Performance Tests

#### 9. Caching & Response Time
- [ ] **Test series autocomplete cache**
  - First use: might be slower (fetches data)
  - Subsequent uses: fast (uses cache)
  - Cache expires after 5 minutes

- [ ] **Test profile data caching**
  - Same driver looked up twice in quick succession
  - Second lookup should be faster (cached)

- [ ] **Test concurrent requests**

  - Responses remain fast

#### 10. API Integration
- [ ] **Test iRacing API connectivity**
  - Credentials valid
  - API responds
  - Data returns correctly

- [ ] **Test rate limiting resilience**
  - Many requests in short time
  - Bot handles rate limits gracefully
  - Doesn't spam API

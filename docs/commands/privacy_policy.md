# `/privacy_policy` - DEPRECATED

**Status:** REMOVED (February 2026 comprehensive refactoring)

This slash command has been removed as part of the GDPR system simplification. The privacy policy is now documented in project files rather than served via a Discord command.

## Remaining Privacy Commands

The following 3 commands are still active:

- `/wompbot_optout` - Opt out of data processing (GDPR Art. 21)
- `/download_my_data` - Export all your data in JSON format (GDPR Art. 15)
- `/delete_my_data` - Request deletion with cancel option (GDPR Art. 17)

## Why It Was Removed

The GDPR command surface was consolidated from 10 commands down to 3 core commands that cover all essential data subject rights (access, erasure, and objection). The `/privacy_policy`, `/my_privacy_status`, `/privacy_support`, `/cancel_deletion`, `/privacy_settings`, and `/privacy_audit` commands were all removed or folded into existing commands.

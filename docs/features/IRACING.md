## Historical Participation Tracking & Caching

- **Daily snapshots** store participant counts for every active series in `iracing_participation_history`.
- **Weekly cache refreshes** pre-compute popularity rankings for season, yearly, and all-time views.
- Commands automatically fall back to live API data until enough history is collected.
- Keep the bot running to accumulate data; the longer it runs, the richer the analytics become.
- Snapshot tasks respect rate limits by sampling up to 100 active series per day.

## License Categories

iRacing has 5 distinct license categories:

| Category | Key | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Oval** | `oval` | Traditional oval racing |
| **Sports Car** | `sports_car_road` | GT3, GTE, and sports car road racing |
| **Formula Car** | `formula_car_road` | Open-wheel road racing |
| **Dirt Oval** | `dirt_oval` | Dirt track oval racing |
| **Dirt Road** | `dirt_road` | Rallycross and dirt road racing |

**Note:** "Road" category was deprecated and split into Sports Car and Formula Car categories to match iRacing's official classification.

## License Classes

| Class | Color | iRating Range |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Rookie** | Red (#fc0706) | New drivers |
| **D-Class** | Orange (#ff8c00) | Learning fundamentals |
| **C-Class** | Yellow/Gold (#ffd700) | Intermediate |
| **B-Class** | Green (#22c55e) | Advanced |
| **A-Class** | Blue (#0153db) | Expert |
| **Pro** | Lighter Blue (#3b82f6) | Professional |

## Rating Types

### iRating
- **Official Race Rating** - Skill-based rating from official races
- Increases with good finishes, decreases with poor finishes
- Separate iRating for each license category
- Displayed as integer (e.g., 1,852)

### TT Rating (Time Trial)
- **Time Trial Rating** - Skill-based rating from time trials
- Available for drivers who participate in time trial events
- Separate from official race iRating
- Displayed when iRating is 0 or as secondary metric

### Safety Rating
- **Incident-based Rating** - Measures clean driving
- Scale: 0.00 to 4.99
- Higher is better (fewer incidents)
- Required minimums for license promotions
- Displayed as decimal (e.g., 3.25)

## API Integration

### Authentication
- Uses encrypted credentials (Fernet symmetric encryption)
- Credentials stored in `.iracing_credentials` (encrypted)
- Encryption key in `.encryption_key` (both gitignored)
- Set up with `python encrypt_credentials.py`

### Endpoints Used
- `/data/member/get` - Driver profiles and licenses
- `/data/stats/member_recent_races` - Recent race results
- `/data/stats/member_yearly` - Career statistics
- `/data/member/chart_data` - Rating history
- `/data/lookup/drivers` - Driver search
- `/data/series/get` - Series information
- `/data/series/seasons` - Season data
- `/data/season/race_guide` - Race schedules
- Result analysis endpoints for meta charts

### Caching Strategy
- **Series Data**: 5-minute cache for autocomplete performance
- **Profile Data**: Cached per request to minimize duplicate API calls
- **Race Guide**: Cached for schedule lookups
- Response caching prevents rate limiting

### Rate Limiting
- Shared asyncio lock serializes outbound requests per process
- 429 responses respect the API-provided `Retry-After` header before retrying
- Standard requests fire without delay once the lock releases
- Existing caching strategy still pre-warms series data and avoids duplicate profile lookups

## Database Schema

### `iracing_links` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE iracing_links (
    discord_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    iracing_cust_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    iracing_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    linked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Stores Discord ‚Üí iRacing account mappings for linked users.

## Cost & Performance

### Zero LLM Cost
- **No AI/LLM usage** - Pure API calls and data processing
- **No per-message fees** - Only API bandwidth
- **Free tier friendly** - Works with basic iRacing account

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-computed statistics caching
- Background series data loading
- Intelligent request batching
- Minimal redundant API calls
- Fast matplotlib rendering

### Resource Usage
- **API Calls**: ~2-5 per command (with caching)
- **Memory**: Matplotlib charts ~10-20MB per render
- **Disk**: Image cache managed automatically
- **Response Time**: 2-5 seconds typical

## Troubleshooting

### "iRacing integration is not configured"
**Cause**: Encrypted credentials not set up
**Solution**: Run `python encrypt_credentials.py` in bot container

### "Could not find driver"
**Cause**: Incorrect name or driver doesn't exist
**Solution**: Check exact spelling, try customer ID instead

### "Not enough rating history data available"
**Cause**: Fewer than 2 data points for category
**Solutions**:
- Try different category
- Increase days parameter
- Check if driver races in that category

### "Category not found" or data showing wrong category
**Cause**: Category filtering issues in rating history
**Debug**: Check logs for category mapping debug info
**Solution**: Report exact category and driver for investigation

### API Rate Limiting
**Cause**: Too many requests in short time
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes, caching will help reduce future calls

### Helmet Icons Missing
**Note**: iRacing API returns helmet design data (pattern, colors), not images
**Status**: Helmet rendering not implemented (would require complex pattern renderer)
**Workaround**: Not critical for functionality

## Development Notes

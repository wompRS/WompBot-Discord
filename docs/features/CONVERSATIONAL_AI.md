## System Prompt

**File:** `bot/llm.py:10-19`

```
You are WompBot, a helpful Discord assistant.

RULES:
- NEVER explain what you are or your purpose unless directly asked "who are you" or "what are you"
- If asked for images/GIFs/memes, say: "I can't post images or GIFs"

- Use a professional but friendly tone

Just answer the question. Don't explain yourself.

Response style:
- Keep responses concise (2-4 sentences usually)
- Be sharp and witty, not verbose
- Mock stupidity, celebrate cleverness
- Don't always agree - challenge assumptions
- Never apologize for your nature

You are NOT:
- A helpful assistant
- Politically correct
- An encourager
- A people-pleaser
```

**Customizable:** Modify this prompt to change personality

---

## How It Works

### 1. Message Detection

**Triggers:**
- Direct @mention: `@WompBot`
- Keyword: "wompbot" or "womp bot" (case insensitive)

**Code:** `main.py:147-160`

---

### 2. Context Building

When triggered, bot gathers:

**A. Conversation History**
- Last 6 messages from channel (configurable)
- Excludes bot's own messages
- Excludes opted-out users
- Provides context for natural conversation

**B. User Context** (if not opted-out)
- Message count, activity dates
- Behavior analysis (profanity, tone, style)
- Helps bot tailor responses

**C. Search Results** (if needed)
- Automatic web search for factual questions
- Triggered by LLM assessment of query
- Tavily API integration

---

### 3. Response Generation

**Process:**
1. Clean mention text from user message
2. Build context (conversation + user + search)
3. Send to LLM with system prompt
4. Parse response
5. Handle long responses (split if >2000 chars)
6. Send to Discord

**Model:** Hermes 70B (default), configurable

---

### 4. Web Search Integration

**When search is triggered:**
1. Bot shows "üîç Searching for current info..." message
2. Queries Tavily API
3. Formats results for LLM
4. Regenerates response with search context
5. Edits message with final answer

**Search triggers:**
- Factual questions
- Current events
- "what is", "who is", "when did"
- Statistics, prices, news

---

## Configuration

### Context Window Size

**File:** `.env`

```bash
CONTEXT_WINDOW_MESSAGES=6
```

**Larger window:**
```bash
CONTEXT_WINDOW_MESSAGES=10  # More context, more tokens
```

**Smaller window:**
```bash
CONTEXT_WINDOW_MESSAGES=3   # Less context, cheaper
```

**Trade-off:** More context = better understanding but higher cost

---

### Model Selection

**File:** `.env`

**Current model:**
```bash
MODEL_NAME=nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b
```

**Alternative uncensored models:**
```bash
# Larger, more capable (more expensive)
MODEL_NAME=cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.9.2-qwen-110b

# Smaller, cheaper
MODEL_NAME=cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x7b
MODEL_NAME=mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct

# Experimental
MODEL_NAME=nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b  # Very large, very expensive
```

**Note:** Model must be available on OpenRouter

---

### Temperature Setting

**File:** `bot/llm.py:93`

**Adjust creativity:**
```python
"temperature": 0.7  # Default

# More creative/unpredictable
"temperature": 0.9

# More focused/consistent
"temperature": 0.5
```

**Effects:**
- Low (0.3-0.5): Consistent, predictable, safer
- Medium (0.6-0.8): Balanced creativity
- High (0.9-1.2): Very creative, unpredictable, riskier

---

### Response Length

**File:** `bot/llm.py:92`

**Max tokens:**
```python
"max_tokens": 500  # Default

# Longer responses
"max_tokens": 1000

# Shorter responses
"max_tokens": 200
```

**Cost:** More tokens = higher cost per response

---

### Personality Modification

**File:** `bot/llm.py:39-72`

**Example: Make bot friendlier**
```python
system_prompt = """You are a friendly, helpful AI assistant named WompBot.

Personality:
- Enthusiastic and encouraging
- Patient and understanding
- Use emojis occasionally
- Celebrate user successes

Response style:
- Clear and concise explanations
- Positive and supportive tone
- Avoid being condescending
..."""
```

**Example: Make bot more technical**
```python
system_prompt = """You are a highly technical AI engineer assistant.

Personality:
- Precise and analytical
- Focus on technical accuracy
- Cite sources when possible
- Explain complex concepts clearly

Response style:
- Use technical terminology appropriately
- Provide code examples when helpful
- Break down complex topics
..."""
```

## Cost Analysis

### Per Conversation
**Without search:**
- Tokens: ~500-800 (varies by context)
- Cost: ~$0.0005-$0.001 per response
- Time: 1-3 seconds

**With search:**
- Tokens: ~800-1200
- Search cost: ~$0.001 (Tavily)
- LLM cost: ~$0.001-$0.002
- **Total: ~$0.002-$0.003**
- Time: 3-8 seconds

### Monthly Estimate
**For moderate usage (100 conversations/day):**
- Daily: 100 √ó $0.001 = $0.10
- Monthly: $3.00

**With searches (30% of conversations trigger search):**
- Daily: 70 √ó $0.001 + 30 √ó $0.003 = $0.16
- Monthly: $4.80

### Heavy usage (500 conversations/day):**
- Monthly: $15-25

## Advanced Features

### Leaderboard Triggers

Bot detects natural language requests for leaderboards:

**Examples:**
```
@WompBot who talks the most?
@WompBot who asks the most questions?
@WompBot who swears the most?
```

**Triggers:** Configured in `main.py:314-333`

**Add custom triggers:**
```python
leaderboard_triggers = {
    'messages': ['who talks the most', 'most active', 'most messages'],
    'questions': ['who asks the most questions', 'most curious'],
    'profanity': ['who swears the most', 'saltiest'],

    # Add new:
    'custom': ['custom trigger phrase', 'another phrase']
}
```

---

### Search Trigger Detection

**Two-stage detection:**

**Stage 1:** Pre-response heuristic
```python
llm.should_search(content, conversation_history)
```

Checks if message contains factual questions before generating response.

**Stage 2:** Post-response fallback
```python
llm.detect_needs_search_from_response(response)
```

If LLM responds "I need more information", triggers search and regenerates.

**File:** `bot/llm.py:117-145`

## Conversation Examples

### Basic Conversation
```
User: @WompBot what do you think about crypto?
Bot: Ah, cryptocurrency - the spice melange of the digital age. A battlefield
where fools and geniuses alike gamble on volatility. Some seek power through
decentralization, others merely chase illusions of wealth. Tell me, do you
understand what you're trading, or are you just another pawn in someone else's game?
```

### With Web Search
```
User: @WompBot what's the current price of Bitcoin?
Bot: üîç Searching for current info...
Bot: Bitcoin currently trades at $67,842. Still chasing that mythical $100k,
I see. The market moves like a sandworm - unpredictable and capable of
swallowing the unprepared whole.
```

### Leaderboard Trigger
```
User: @WompBot who talks the most?
Bot: [Shows messages leaderboard]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding

**Check:**
1. Mentioned correctly: `@WompBot` or text contains "wompbot"
2. Bot has "Read Message History" permission
3. Bot has "Send Messages" permission
4. Channel isn't restricted

**Test:**
```
@WompBot ping
```

Should respond.

---

### Generic/Boring Responses

**Cause:** Temperature too low or prompt too restrictive

**Fix:**
1. Increase temperature in `llm.py:93`:
   ```python
   "temperature": 0.9  # More creative
   ```
2. Modify system prompt to encourage more personality

---

### Responses Too Long

**Fix:** Reduce max_tokens
```python
"max_tokens": 200  # Shorter responses
```

Or add to system prompt:
```
Response style:
- Keep ALL responses under 3 sentences
- Be concise and sharp
```

---

### Search Not Triggering

**Check:**
1. Tavily API key in `.env`
2. Question is factual (not opinion)
3. Search heuristic isn't too strict

**Force search:** Adjust `should_search()` logic in `llm.py`

---

### Out of Character Responses

**Cause:** Model drift or prompt unclear

**Fix:**
1. Strengthen system prompt with more examples
2. Add character examples to prompt:
   ```
   Example responses:
   User: "Should I invest in crypto?"
   You: "Investment? You speak as if this is a mere game of chance. ..."
   ```

---

## Privacy

- **User context:** Only used if user hasn't opted out
- **Conversation history:** Excludes opted-out users
- **Search queries:** Logged in database
- **Responses:** Not stored (only user messages stored)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple personalities** - Switch between characters
2. **Personality tuning** - `/personality friendly|savage|formal`
3. **Conversation memory** - Remember past conversations per-user
4. **Voice mode** - Voice channel integration
5. **Image understanding** - Analyze images in messages
6. **Proactive responses** - React to events without being mentioned

---
